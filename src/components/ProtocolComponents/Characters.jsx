                            As the Keepers began to emerge and find prominence, they were feared by some... but also recognised by many as beacons of hope. From among their fold emerged Sentinels, leaders of particular merit that could help guide the fledgling communities of New Eden and unite warring factions under new goals of peace and prosperity.

                            Sentinels serve a pivotal role in the KPR universe, as they provide detailed feedback and support for everything we do while also embodying the change they want to see and contributing to the successful running of New Eden as a whole. Becoming a Sentinel is both a privilege and a responsibility, unlocking new kinds of value and opportunity that come from being a strong pillar of a forward-looking society.
